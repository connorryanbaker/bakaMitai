# Baka Mitai

Named after the soundtrack to all brilliant chess moves, Baka Mitai is a low
strength, WIP chess engine.

Currently, Baka Mitai runs a Negamax search with Alpha/Beta pruning and
a couple of simple evaluation functions on leaf nodes. 

Upcoming features to be implemented are listed in todo.txt.
